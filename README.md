# EmailNotifier
This project's .jar file upon integration as a shell script allows you to receive automated email messages to your gmail 
inbox(currently works only for @gmail.com) regarding the current location of the laptop or pc right after the bootup. 
Information sent includes: Continent, Country, City, District, Zip, newtwork IP, Latitude and Longitude(the last two are 
fairly precise, however not to be relied upon as the data is taken from public and open database). You will also receive 
a time stamp of the bootup.
